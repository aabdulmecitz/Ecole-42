## Introduction
École 42 is a renowned programming school that emphasizes peer-to-peer learning and project-based education. This repository showcases my progress and achievements through various challenging projects, starting from the intensive 42 Piscine to the advanced 42 Common Core curriculum.

## 42 Piscine
The **42 Piscine** is a rigorous 4-week coding bootcamp designed to test problem-solving skills, adaptability, and teamwork. Below is a summary of the key exercises and projects I completed during the Piscine:

| **Project/Exercise**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shell Basics               | Learned basic shell commands and scripting.                                     |
| C Basics                   | Mastered fundamental C programming concepts, including loops, functions, and pointers. |
| Algorithms                 | Solved algorithmic challenges such as sorting and recursion.                    |
| Group Projects             | Collaborated with peers to complete mini-projects under tight deadlines.        |

## 42 Common Core
The **42 Common Core** is the main curriculum that focuses on advanced programming concepts, algorithms, and system-level programming. Below is an overview of the key milestones:

| **Project**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Libft](https://github.com/aabdulmecitz/42-Libft)                      | Built a custom implementation of standard C library functions.                  |
| [Ft_printf](https://github.com/aabdulmecitz/42-printf)              | Recreated the printf function in C with custom formatting options.              |
| [Get Next Line](https://github.com/aabdulmecitz/42-get-next-line)      | Developed a program to read a file line by line.                                |
| [Born2beroot](https://github.com/aabdulmecitz/42-Born2beroot)          | Configured a virtual machine and learned system administration basics.          |
| [So Long](https://github.com/aabdulmecitz/42-so_long)                  | Developed a 2D game using the MiniLibX library.                                 |
| [Pipex](https://github.com/aabdulmecitz/42-pipex)                      | Built a program to mimic the behavior of shell pipelines.                       |
| [Push Swap](https://github.com/aabdulmecitz/42-Push-Swap)              | Implemented sorting algorithms with minimal operations.                         |
| [Philosophers](https://github.com/aabdulmecitz/42-Philosophers)        | Tackled multithreading and synchronization challenges.                          |
| [Minishell](https://github.com/aliemirdinc/minishell)                 | Created a simple shell with basic command execution and piping.                 |
| [Cub3D](https://github.com/aabdulmecitz/42-cube3D)                         | Designed a 3D game engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.                           |
